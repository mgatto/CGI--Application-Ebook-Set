            This ebook is a collection of documentation for CGI::Application and commonly associated modules, specially formatted for modern ereaders. Chapters are clearly delineated and custom fonts are embedded. The default stylesheet is derived from chromatic's "Modern Perl" website, Metacpan's web stylesheet and the CSS used in perldoc.perl.org.

            I've also added content from annocpan.org, and attributed any annoations which were included into this compilation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've taken some liberties in editing the original documentation. Among others, I've removed sections about deprecated features. My reasoning was that most readers hopefully will be using the latest versions of these modules from CPAN.
