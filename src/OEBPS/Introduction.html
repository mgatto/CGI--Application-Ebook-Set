            This ebook is a collection of documentation for CGI::Application and commonly associated modules, specially formatted for modern ereaders. Chapters are clearly delineated and custom fonts are embedded. The default stylesheet is derived from chromatic&apos;s &quot;Modern Perl&quot; website, Metacpan&apos;s web stylesheet and the CSS used in perldoc.perl.org.
        </p>
        
        <p>Included is the documentation and additional materials for what I consider a reasonable "recent" modern web application stack in Perl:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The Core CGI::Application</li>
            <li>CGI.pm, provider of the Query object to CGI::Application</li>
        	<li>Templating with HTML::Template</li>
         	<li>Forms, with CGI::FormBuilder</li>
        	<li>CGI::Session &amp; CGI::Application::Plugin::Session</li>
        	<li>Plugins &amp; modules for deploying with PSGI, FastCGI, and Mod_Perl</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            I've taken some liberties in editing the original documentation. Among others, I've removed sections about deprecated features. My reasoning was that most readers hopefully will be using the latest versions of these modules from CPAN.
        </p>
        <p>
            The additional content was derived from annocpan.org; I've attributed any annoations which were included into this compilation.
